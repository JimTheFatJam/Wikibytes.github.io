				<p>The <b>motherboard</b> is the heart of a PC. It is often regarded as the "spine" or "backbone" of the system due to its essential role in connecting and facilitating communication between various computer components (Volle, 2023). While manufacturers may use terms like system board, planar board, baseboard, or main board—and Intel refers to its versions as desktop boards—the motherboard is universally recognized as the defining element of a computer (Thompson & Thompson, 2009). The image depicts the Dell Precision T3600 system motherboard. Manufactured in 2012, this motherbaord a component used in professional CAD workstations (Wieclaw, 2019).</p>
				<p>Constructed from a rigid, non-conductive base material, typically plastic, a motherboard features intricate circuits formed by thin copper or aluminum "traces" that link its components. These circuits lead to slots where key hardware such as the CPU, RAM, storage drives, and expansion cards, including graphics cards and sound adapters, are installed. Additionally, the motherboard includes sockets for connecting hard drives and other devices via cables, as well as ports for external peripherals like monitors and input devices (Volle, 2023).</p>
				<p class="with-bar">When assembling a PC, selecting the right motherboard is a critical and often challenging decision. When upgrading a PC, replacing the motherboard can be an economical and effective solution. When purchasing a PC, the chosen motherboard significantly impacts its performance, features, and potential for future upgrades (Thompson & Thompson, 2009).</p>
                
				<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
				<p>The different types of motherboards can be distinguished by various features, including their physical design, collectively referred to as the form factor, the chipset that determines the motherboard's functionality, the processors it is compatible with, the BIOS it employs, and the types of internal and expansion buses it supports (Thompson & Thompson, 2009). Understanding these components of a motherboard and their various functions is crucial for anyone looking to build, upgrade, or troubleshoot their system. The image presents the basic components of a motherboard (Strydom, 2024).</p>

				<h3 id="form-factor">Form Factor</h3>
				<p>Motherboards differ in size, shape, placement of mounting holes, type of power supply connectors, and the types and locations of ports. These variations collectively define the motherboard's form factor (Thompson & Thompson, 2009). A motherboard's form factor is a standard that specifies the dimensions of the motherboard for a personal computer. It defines how the motherboard fits within the case, including the placement of interfaces, ports, CPU socket, RAM slots, and the type of connector used to link the power supply (Поликарпова, 2015).</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="chipsets">Chipsets</h3>
				<p>Just as the motherboard defines a PC, the chipset defines the motherboard. It determines key features such as the processors the motherboard can support, the types of RAM it is compatible with, the bus types and speeds it can handle, and whether it supports standards like AGP and USB (Thompson & Thompson, 2009). The image below shows an Intel Pentium Dual-Core E2220 2.40 GHz processor paired with an Intel i945GC Express Chipset, mounted on an Intel D945GCCR motherboard (Villa, 2019). The chipset plays a vital role in system performance by managing communication between the processor and external devices. In x86-based computers, the term "chipset" often refers to the combination of two chips: the northbridge and southbridge. The northbridge connects the CPU to high-speed devices like RAM and graphics controllers, while the southbridge links to slower peripheral buses (e.g., PCI or ISA). Many modern southbridges also include integrated peripherals, such as Ethernet, USB, and audio devices (Schmid, 2002).</p>

				<h2 id="types-of-motherboards">Types of Motherboards</h2>
				<p class="with-bar">Most motherboard manufacturers adhere to form factor standards to prevent compatibility issues with peripheral devices and expansion cards. Поликарпова (2015) categorizes motherboard form factors into three categories: obsolete, modern, and prospective.</p>
				
				<h3 id="obsolete">Obselete Form Factors</h3>
				<p>Obsolete form factors today were the first standards of motherboards.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">•&emsp;<b>Full AT (Advanced Technology)</b>, corresponding to the original IBM AT computer.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">•&emsp;<b>Baby AT</b>, introduced by IBM in 1984, was smaller than the AT form factor and used fewer chips, with a 16-bit system.</p>
				<p>•&emsp;<b>LPX (Low Profile eXtension)</b> and <b>Mini-LPX</b>, developed by Western Digital in 1987, featured connectors arranged to keep expansion cards parallel to the system board, allowing for smaller, low-profile cases (Поликарпова, 2015).</p>

				<h2 id="how">How To Choose a Motherboard</h2>
				<p>These tables provides clear overview of the capabilities and features associated with each motherboard form factor, helping users make informed purhcasing decisions based on their needs for CPU power, memory capacity, and expansion options. Selecting the appropriate form factor is essential to ensure that a system meets user requirements while allowing for future upgrades and efficient cooling solutions. ATX is ideal for gamers and professionals, Micro ATX suits general users, and eXtended ATX is best for workstations and power users. Each form factor offers distinct advantages, making it important to choose based on your specific requirements (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). Поликарпова (2015) enumerates several rules when choosing the appropriate motherboard based on your needs:</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">1.&emsp;<b>Choose reputable manufacturers</b> (such as ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, and MSI) to ensure quality and reliability.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">2.&emsp;<b>Check important specifications</b> like compatibility with processors, memory, and expansion slots.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">3.&emsp;<b>Start with lower-cost options</b> and evaluate their features and performance to stay within your budget.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">4.&emsp;<b>Shortlist a few suitable models</b> that meet your requirements and compare their prices.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">5.&emsp;<b>Visit the manufacturers’ websites</b> to review detailed information on each motherboard, including supported processors and operating systems.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">6.&emsp;<b>Examine product images carefully</b>, paying close attention to the number and types of connectors, as well as the cooling system.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">7.&emsp;<b>Compare the pros and cons</b> of each motherboard to make an informed decision.</p>
				<p class="with-bar">8.&emsp;<b>Purchase the motherboard</b> that offers the best balance between features and price.</p>

				<p class="with-bar">As members of the general public, we tend to overlook what goes into the technology we use today. Learning about motherboards, their significance, capabilities, and the many form factors they come in has brought me a step closer to understanding the computer systems that run our lives. Understanding how the motherboard serves as the central hub for all hardware components, and how different form factors influences expansion limits, cooling, and space requirements, has made me realize the importance of selecting the right motherboard for specific needs. This knowledge not only deepens my appreciation of modern computers but also equips me to make more informed decisions when building or upgrading systems in the future whether at home or in the office.</p>
