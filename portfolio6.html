				</div>
				<p class="with-bar">The various types of computers can be characterized by several defining attributes, including their <b>name/brand</b> (manufacturer, make, model), <b>build</b> (size, dimensions, or physical design), and <b>CPU</b> specifications such as clock frequency, instructions per second, multi-core processing capabilities, number of transistors, front-side bus, and cache. Additionally, their <b>memory</b> capacity and speed and <b>processing speed</b> (number of processor cores and clock rate) play crucial roles in determining performance. Other essential factors include <b>calculating power</b>, which is measured in <b>FLOPS</b> (floating-point operations per second) and <b>MIPS</b> (million instructions per second) units, their <b>working principle</b>, or how the computer operates and processes information, <b>energy consumption</b> which includes power efficiency and energy requirements, and the <b>fields of use</b> which encompass their applications in industries where the type computer excels. Together, these criteria provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and comparing different types of computers.</p>
						
				<h2 id="types">Types of Computers</h2>
				<p class="with-bar">Computers are classified into distinct categories based on their processing power, storage capacity, and intended applications. These include supercomputers for advanced scientific computations, mainframes for large-scale data processing, minicomputers for mid-range tasks, servers for managing network operations, workstations for specialized individual tasks, and microcomputers for personal or small-scale use. Each type is designed to fulfill specific requirements, making them integral to various industries and everyday applications.</p>
				
				<h3 id="supercomputer">Supercomputer</h3>
				<p>A supercomputer is a highly advanced system designed for rapid, high-performance computations, primarily used in scientific, engineering, and national security fields. These systems feature multiple CPUs, large storage capacities, innovative cooling techniques, and fast input/output capabilities to handle complex tasks like weather forecasting, cryptography, and physical simulations. Supercomputers excel in vector arithmetic and are measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). With significant memory capacity, often in the petabyte range, they rely on parallel processing and typically use Linux-based operating systems. Once exclusive to government and research, supercomputers are now used across industries like aerospace, petroleum, and gaming (Hosch, 2024; BasuMallick, 2022).</p>
				<p>Examples of cutting-edge supercomputers include <b>Fugaku by Fujitsu</b>, dedicated to tackling global challenges like climate change with record-breaking 442 petaflops; <b>Google Sycamore</b>, a quantum processor capable of computations traditional systems would take millennia to solve; and <b>IBM's Summit</b>, which excels in scientific research like genetics and material science. Other notable systems include <b>Microsoft’s cloud supercomputer for OpenAI</b>, <b>Meta's AI Research SuperCluster</b>, and virtual supercomputing platforms like <b>AWS's EC2</b>, which offer scalable, cloud-based solutions for high-performance computing (BasuMallick , 2022).</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="mainframe">Mainframe Computer</h3>
				<p>Mainframes are powerful computers designed for large-scale data processing, offering features like dual processors, high storage capacity, and multiple I/O cards for redundancy. They provide RAS-based performance (reliability, availability, and serviceability), fault-tolerant computing, and clustering capabilities for seamless operation across systems. Mainframes can run multiple operating systems simultaneously and dynamically reconfigure without downtime. Known for handling high transaction volumes, secure cloud integration, and modern tech like blockchain, they are scalable, secure, and essential for mission-critical applications (BasuMallick, 2023).</p>
				<p>Examples include the <b>IBM Z series</b>, with advanced AI capabilities and compatibility with decades-old systems; the latest IBM z16 supports trillions of daily transactions. The <b>FUJITSU Server GS21</b> excels in 24/7 mission-critical operations with reduced costs, though it will be phased out by 2030. Historical systems like the <b>UNIVAC 9400</b> showcase mainframes’ longevity, still functional in a German museum. These systems highlight mainframes’ critical role in industries like finance, banking, and government, where reliability and processing power are paramount (BasuMallick, 2023).</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="mini">Mini Computer</h3>
				<p>Minicomputers are mid-sized computers that emerged in the late 1950s, offering a balance between the large-scale power of mainframes and the limited capabilities of personal computers. Smaller, less costly, and less powerful than mainframes, but more capable than personal computers, minicomputers were commonly used for tasks like scientific and engineering calculations, business transaction processing, file management, and database operations. They became particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s. These machines are characterized by their ability to support multiple users simultaneously, their powerful processors capable of performing concurrent calculations, and their capacity to connect with external peripherals like printers and scanners. While minicomputers were essential in fields like telecommunications, healthcare, and manufacturing, their popularity declined in the 1980s and 1990s, as they were replaced by more advanced personal computers, workstations, and small to mid-sized servers. Despite this, they remain known for their cost-effectiveness, multi-user support, and strong processing capabilities (Britannica, 2022; GeeksforGeeks, 2023).</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="server">Server</h3>
				<p>A server is a powerful computing system designed to manage, store, and process data over a network, providing resources and services to client devices. Servers can handle tasks like hosting websites, managing emails, processing data, and supporting network operations. They consist of key components like processors (CPUs), RAM, storage, and high bandwidth to ensure efficient performance. Servers operate under a client-server model, where they respond to user requests, and are categorized into various types, including web, mail, application, database, DNS, proxy, DHCP, file, and print servers. Key features of servers include scalability, high processing power, reliability, cost savings, enhanced collaboration, and security against cyberattacks, making them essential for businesses and organizations globally (Kanade, 2023).</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="workstation">Workstation</h3>
				<p>A workstation is a high-performance computer designed for a single user, offering advanced graphics capabilities, large storage, and a powerful processor. It is more capable than a personal computer (PC) but less advanced than a server. Workstations are used for computationally intensive tasks, particularly in scientific, engineering, and complex financial applications. They are known for handling high-resolution graphics, multitasking software, and facilitating communication with other computers. While workstations traditionally differ from PCs due to their advanced graphics and processing power, high-end PCs now often have similar capabilities, making the distinction between the two less clear (Britannica, 2021). Some examples of popular workstation-specific brands include <b>Dell Precision workstations</b>, <b>Lenovo P Series workstations</b>, and <b>Z by HP workstations</b>.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="with-bar"></p>
				
				<h3 id="micro">Micro Computer</h3>
				<p>A microcomputer is an electronic device that uses a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU), performing all logic and arithmetic operations. Initially introduced in the mid-1970s, microcomputers were small digital computers with a single integrated semiconductor chip containing the CPU, memory, and interface circuits. As technology advanced with large-scale and very-large-scale integration, microcomputers' processing capacity grew, expanding their use beyond entertainment systems to include personal computers, workstations, business, engineering, manufacturing, and military electronics by the 1980s. Compact and low-cost, microcomputers are designed for personal or small-scale use, featuring memory, storage, and input/output devices. They are widely used in fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment, offering increased productivity and portability. Despite their advantages, microcomputers have limitations, including limited processing power, storage capacity, and security risks. Examples include personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops, tablets, desktops, and workstations (Britannica, 2024; GeeksforGeeks, 2024).</p>
				<p>By the early 2000s, the term "microcomputer" declined in everyday use, particularly after its peak in the mid-1980s. It was originally associated with popular 8-bit home computers like the <b>Apple II</b>, <b>ZX Spectrum</b>, and <b>Commodore 64</b>, as well as small-business CP/M-based systems. In colloquial language, "microcomputer" has largely been replaced by "personal computer" or "PC," a term first coined in 1959, referring to computers designed for individual use (Oxford University Press, 2013).</p>
