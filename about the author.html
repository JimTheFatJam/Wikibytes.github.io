				<p class="with-bar" style="width: 76%;">Jemuel S. Valencia is a computer science student with a strong interest in technology and programming. His hobbies include running, exercising, and playing table tennis. Jemuel has been a student at the University of San Carlos (USC) since Grade 5. Prior to this, he spent nine years living in Kuwait with his parents before returning to the Philippines. Currently, he resides in Talisay City, Cebu, but temporarily stays in a dorm near USC Talamban Campus.</p>
				
				<h2 id="educational-background">Educational Background</h2>
                <p>Jemuel completed his Senior High School education under the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strand at the University of San Carlos - Basic Education Department (BED) North Campus in Cebu City, graduating with High Honors. He also completed his Junior High School education at the same institution, likewise graduating with High Honors.</p>
				<p class="with-bar">During his academic journey, Jemuel was introduced to programming through courses such as <em>Computer Fundamentals and Programming 1</em>, where he learned the basics of C programming. In Junior High School, he gained hands-on experience programming Arduino devices using C++ as part of the Technology and Livelihood Education curriculum. Additionally, he participated in a work immersion program in collaboration with USC and Lexmark, where he engaged in organizational tasks, gaining practical exposure to the field of technology.</p>
                
				<h2 id="why-computer-science">Why Computer Science</h2>
				<p>Jemuel’s decision to pursue a degree in computer science was largely influenced by his father, a senior computer programmer working with multiple companies. Witnessing his father’s achievements and the opportunities in the field inspired Jemuel to follow a similar path.</p>
                <p>The ongoing advancements in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, faster processors, and computer hardware, further reinforced his decision. Jemuel believes the computer science field holds immense potential, given its rapid evolution and the increasing demand for skilled professionals in the technology industry. His aspiration is to contribute to this dynamic and ever-expanding domain.</p>
